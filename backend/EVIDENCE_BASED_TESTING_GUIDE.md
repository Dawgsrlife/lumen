## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üìã Testing Scenarios by Clinical Evidence

### üß† Scenario 1: Depression Assessment (PHQ-9 Based)

**Clinical Context**: Testing AI's ability to identify depression indicators using PHQ-9 validated criteria.

**Test Steps**:

1. **Navigate to Journal Tab ‚Üí Audio**
2. **Record or upload audio** saying:
   ```
   "I've been feeling really down lately. Nothing seems interesting anymore, 
   not even things I used to love doing. I'm tired all the time, can't focus 
   at work, and I keep thinking I'm worthless. I've been having trouble 
   sleeping and just feel hopeless about everything."
   ```

3. **Expected AI Analysis**:
   - **PHQ-9 Indicators Detected**: Anhedonia, fatigue, concentration issues, worthlessness, sleep disturbance, hopelessness
   - **Risk Assessment**: Medium to High
   - **CBT Interventions**: Behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring for hopelessness
   - **Audio Analysis**: Slower speech rate, reduced vocal variation (depression biomarkers)

### üåä Scenario 2: Anxiety Assessment (GAD-7 Based)

**Clinical Context**: Testing GAD-7 anxiety screening with DBT interventions.

**Test Steps**:

1. **Create Text Journal Entry**:
   ```
   Content: "I can't stop worrying about everything. My mind races constantly, 
   I feel restless and on edge. I worry about work, relationships, health - 
   you name it. I can't relax and it's making me irritable with everyone."
   
   Mood: anxiety
   Tags: work, worry, restlessness
   ```

2. **Expected AI Analysis**:
   - **GAD-7 Indicators**: Excessive worry, restlessness, relaxation difficulty, irritability
   - **DBT Skills Recommended**: TIPP for acute distress, mindfulness for worry reduction
   - **MBSR Techniques**: Breath awareness meditation, body scan
   - **Intensity Adjustment**: Likely +1 or +2 based on severity

### üåü Scenario 3: Trauma-Informed Assessment

**Clinical Context**: Testing PTSD-5 screening with trauma-informed care principles.

**Test Steps**:

1. **Audio Journal Entry** (simulate with file upload):
   ```
   "I keep having these flashbacks to the accident. I can't drive anymore, 
   I avoid that whole part of town. I feel disconnected from everyone, 
   like I'm watching my life from outside. I'm always on high alert, 
   jumping at every sound."
   ```

2. **Expected AI Analysis**:
   - **PTSD-5 Indicators**: Re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, hypervigilance
   - **Trauma-Informed Approach**: Safety prioritization, window of tolerance assessment
   - **Interventions**: Grounding techniques, nervous system regulation
   - **Professional Referral**: Likely recommended for specialized trauma therapy

### üíä Scenario 4: Comprehensive Clinical Assessment

**Clinical Context**: Testing multi-modal analysis with neurobiological considerations.

**Test Steps**:

1. **Create Multiple Data Points**:
   - **Emotion Entry**: Frustration, intensity 7
   - **Journal Entry**: "Stressed about work deadline, sleeping poorly"
   - **Game Session**: 45 minutes, emotionBefore: stress, completed

2. **Navigate to Clinical Analytics Tab**
3. **Click "Get Clinical Overview"**

4. **Expected Comprehensive Analysis**:
   - **HPA Axis Assessment**: Stress response pattern identification
   - **Sleep-Mood Connection**: Circadian rhythm impact analysis
   - **Polyvagal Theory Application**: Nervous system state assessment
   - **Neuroplasticity Recommendations**: Brain-training activities

## üéôÔ∏è Audio Analysis Testing

### Voice Biomarker Detection

**Test Audio Samples** (record or simulate):

1. **Depression Sample**: Slow, monotone speech with long pauses
2. **Anxiety Sample**: Rapid speech with vocal tremor
3. **Neutral Sample**: Normal pace and variation

**Expected Voice Analysis**:
- **Transcription Accuracy**: Complete speech-to-text conversion
- **Emotional Tone**: Detected from prosody and pace
- **Clinical Indicators**: Research-backed voice biomarkers
- **Speech Patterns**: Coherence, processing time, thought organization

## üìä Evidence-Based Intervention Testing

### CBT Technique Recommendations

**Test with Various Scenarios**:

1. **Catastrophizing Pattern**:
   ```
   Journal: "Everything is going to go wrong at the presentation. 
   I'll mess up, everyone will think I'm incompetent, and I'll lose my job."
   ```
   
   **Expected CBT Response**:
   - Cognitive distortion identified: Catastrophizing, fortune telling
   - Technique: Thought challenging, evidence examination
   - Behavioral experiment: Gradual exposure to presentation scenarios

2. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**:
   ```
   Journal: "I made one mistake on the project so I'm a complete failure. 
   I can never do anything right."
   ```
   
   **Expected CBT Response**:
   - Distortion: All-or-nothing thinking, labeling
   - Technique: Gray-area thinking, self-compassion exercises
   - Homework: Daily accomplishment logging

### DBT Skills Integration

**Test Distress Tolerance Scenarios**:

1. **Crisis Situation**:
   ```
   Audio: "I'm so overwhelmed I want to hurt myself. Everything feels 
   too much and I don't know how to cope."
   ```
   
   **Expected DBT Response**:
   - **Immediate**: TIPP techniques for crisis survival
   - **Risk Assessment**: High risk, safety planning needed
   - **Skills**: Distress surfing, radical acceptance
   - **Professional Alert**: Crisis intervention protocols
