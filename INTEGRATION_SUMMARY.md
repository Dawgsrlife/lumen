# Frontend-Backend Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete integration between the Lumen frontend and backend, implementing the full user flow from emotion tracking to therapeutic games and AI voice chat.

## 🎯 Complete User Flow

### 1. **Landing Page → Authentication**
- User lands on the landing page
- Signs in via Clerk authentication
- Redirected to welcome page with animated message

### 2. **Dashboard → Emotion Selection**
- User sees emotion selector with 9 emotions
- **Backend Integration**: Selected emotions are saved to MongoDB via `/api/emotions`
- Emotions are tied to authenticated user via Clerk ID
- Real-time confirmation with loading states

### 3. **Automatic Game Mapping**
- **Emotion-to-Game Mapping**:
  - `anxiety/frustration/stress/fear` → `boxbreathing` (calming breathing exercise)
  - `sadness` → `colorbloom` (bring colors back to grayscale world)
  - `grief/loneliness` → `memorylantern` (release memories to sky)
  - `lethargy` → `rythmgrow` (rhythm game for energy)
  - `happy` → `colorbloom` (enhance positive feelings)
  - `fear/anxiety` → `boxbreathing` (grounding exercise)

### 4. **Games Page**
- Auto-redirects to appropriate game based on selected emotion
- Game selection via URL parameters (`/games?game=boxbreathing`)
- Placeholder game interface ready for Unity integration

### 5. **Clinic Page → AI Voice Chat**
- New `/clinic` route added to navigation
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time voice chat using Gemini Live API
- **Therapeutic Context**: AI assistant aware of user's recent emotions and mood
- **Evidence-Based Techniques**: CBT, DBT, mindfulness approaches
- **Fallback Support**: Text input when voice fails

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Updates
- **Authentication**: Updated to handle both Clerk tokens and user IDs (hackathon mode)
- **Voice Chat**: WebSocket server with Gemini Live API integration
- **Database**: Emotion entries stored with user context
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /api/emotions` - Save emotion entries
  - `POST /api/voice-chat/start` - Initialize voice session
  - `POST /api/voice-chat/end/:sessionId` - End and save session
  - `GET /api/voice-chat/status` - Check service availability

### Frontend Updates
- **Dashboard**: Integrated with backend API for emotion tracking
- **Games**: Dynamic game selection based on emotion mapping
- **Clinic**: Complete voice chat interface with WebSocket connection
- **Navigation**: Added Clinic to header menu
- **API Service**: Enhanced with voice chat methods and proper authentication

### Data Flow
1. **Emotion Selection** → MongoDB (via API)
2. **Game Mapping** → URL parameters → Games page
3. **Voice Chat** → WebSocket → Gemini Live API → MongoDB (session storage)

## 🧠 AI Therapeutic Features

### Voice Chat Capabilities
- **Real-time Transcription**: Live audio-to-text conversion
- **Contextual Responses**: AI aware of user's emotional state
- **Therapeutic Techniques**: 
  - CBT for thought reframing
  - DBT for distress tolerance
  - Mindfulness for grounding
  - Narrative therapy for processing
- **Session Recording**: Conversations saved for future reference

### Therapeutic Approach by Emotion
- **Anger/Frustration**: DBT techniques, grounding exercises
- **Sadness**: CBT reframing, behavioral activation
- **Anxiety**: Exposure hierarchy, breathing scripts
- **Grief**: Acceptance, narrative therapy prompts
- **Loneliness**: IFS-style parts work, attachment lens
